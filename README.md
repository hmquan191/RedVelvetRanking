ðŸŽ‰ Red Velvet 10th Anniversary Celebration Website ðŸŽ‰
Hello, everyone! I'm Liam, and this is my very first project building a website, created to celebrate the 10th Anniversary of Red Velvet.

ðŸŒŸ Website: https://redvelvetranking.onrender.com/

ðŸŒŸ Features:

1. Top Albums Leaderboard:
  
  Fetches data from Last.fm to display the play count and total listeners for the top 11 Red Velvet albums.

2. Latest Videos:

  Retrieves 15 most recent videos from Red Velvet's official YouTube page using the YouTube Data API (v3).

3. Spotify Album Previews:

  Allows users to listen to Red Velvet's albums through Spotify.

4. Lucky Card Generator:

  A fun feature to generate random pictures of Red Velvet members. Each click reveals a new image.

5. Build Your Squad:

  Click the "Hit It" button to see a slot-machine-style formation of Red Velvet members! Discover your lineup of the day with randomly generated images of the group members.

ðŸš€ Technologies Used
