ðŸŽ‰ Red Velvet 10th Anniversary Celebration Website ðŸŽ‰
Hello, everyone! I'm Liam, and this is my very first project building a website, created to celebrate the 10th Anniversary of Red Velvet.

ðŸŒŸ Features:

1. Top Albums Leaderboard:

Fetches data from Last.fm to display the play count and total listeners for the top 11 Red Velvet albums.
2. Latest Videos:

Retrieves the 10 most recent videos from Red Velvet's official YouTube page using the YouTube Data API (v3).
Note: This feature currently works only on local hosting due to API restrictions on deployed sites.

3. Spotify Album Previews:

Allows users to listen to Red Velvet's albums through Spotify. (Requires Spotify to be installed on the user's device to access previews.)

4. Lucky Card Generator:

A fun feature to generate random pictures of Red Velvet members. Each click reveals a new formation!

5. Build Your Squad:

Click the "Hit It" button to see a slot-machine-style formation of Red Velvet members! Discover your lineup of the day with randomly generated images of the group members.

ðŸš€ Technologies Used
HTML / CSS / JavaScript for the frontend
Node.js and Express for the backend
YouTube Data API (v3) and Last.fm API for external data fetching

ðŸ“¢ Notes
The YouTube Data API feature works locally, but may not run on the deployed web due to API key restrictions.
The Spotify preview requires the Spotify application to be installed for access.
Thank you for checking out my project!
